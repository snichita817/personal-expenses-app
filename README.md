# Personal Expenses App

The Personal Expenses App is a mobile application built using the Dart and Flutter framework that allows users to track their personal expenses. Users can add expenses with the date, title and amount. They can also view their expenses in a list, and a chart, showing the relative amount spent for the week, edit or delete them as needed.

## Installation

To install and run the app, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/snichita817/personal-expenses-app.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (such as VS Code)
3. Run `flutter pub get` to download and install the required dependencies
4. Connect your mobile device or emulator and run the app using the `flutter run` command

## Using the App
Once the app is running, you can add a new expense by tapping the "+" button in the upper right corner of the screen. This will take you to a form where you can enter the details of the expense, including the amount, date, and title.
